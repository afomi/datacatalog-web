## Personas

Personas are a useful way to think about the stakeholders for our project. We have included a few below.

### Bill, civic hacker

Bill got his start by parsing FEC data, and he's played with THOMAS as well. He's getting bored of hacking on Congress, so he wants to get some obscure data from the Executive branch's agencies, and maybe try some things on the state and local level. As a hacker with ADHD, Bill has little patience, so he wants to find datasets fast, wants to be sure that the data is what he expects, and wants to be able to get it on his computer with minimal hassle.

### Maude, investigative journalist

Maude works for a non-profit news organization. She has some pretty good skills with Excel and Access, but doesn't consider herself to be a developer. Maude's focus is on the influence of money in politics, at all levels of government. She wants to see what kind of data is out there, keep tabs on useful data sets that can support her work, and ultimately use that data to produce groundbreaking stories.

### Sam, employee for a state's CIO office

Sam wants to see his state's government open up and become more transparent. As an employee of his state's CIO, he's been pushing to revamp the websites, participate in social media, and publish data sets. He's thinking of running his own contest like Apps for Democracy and Apps for America. Sam wants to make sure that his hard work is reaching the right people.

### Joanna, staffer at the Sunlight Labs

Joanna curates the data catalog. As such, she wants an easy way to enter in new data sources and mark them up appropriately. Also, she handles the processing of submissions from government agencies and non-profits who publish their own data sources. She also does light content management, such as setting "Featured Data Sources" for viewing on the homepage and updating copy from time to time.
